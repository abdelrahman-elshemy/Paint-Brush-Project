# Paint-Brush-Project
Paint Brush is a Jframe based application that enables the user to draw basic shapes with
different colors and line strokes. In addition, the user should have the ability to clear all the
drawings or erase some parts of them. The user would be happy if the applications
supported Undo operations.
